  * Create a function that takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the same array in ascending order. Using sort() would be easy, but for this challenge YOU have to sort the array creating your own algorithm.

 sortArray([23, 15, 34, 17, -28]) ➞ [-28, 15, 17, 23, 34]

 The arrays won't contain duplicate numbers.
